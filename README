# hetzner_cloud dynamic inventory

## Introduction

Ansible inventories can be provided dynamically by inventory scripts. This
script is an ansible dynamic inventory for the [Hetzner
Cloud](https://console.hetzner.cloud).

## Setup

* Create an account, a project within it and some hosts. You've probably
  already done that, or you wouldn't be here.
* In your project, in `Zug√§nge`, `API-TOKENS`, create a new api token.
* Get that token into the environment variable `HCLOUD_API_TOKEN`.
* Make the `hetzner_cloud` script executable and put it into your ansible
  inventory. One way to do that is to replace your current static inventory
  file with a directory (probably moving your original inventory into it) and
  put the `hetzner_cloud` script into that directory, too.
